# 2018NYMakerFaireAutoFlagger

For all kind of road or bridge construction, or public outdoor service, which involve the action to block bi-direction traffic into one direction traffic, it will require at least a pair of construction worker, called Flagger.

Flagger can be very expensive, pay as low as $15 per hour, as much as $30 per hour, so, for a regular 1 weeks (5 working day) project, it will be 40 * 2 hours of Flagger service, which will be as little as $1200, as much as $2400, which is a lot of money to be spent.

To solve this problem, Tiger Peng and David Peng team up to design and create a series of automatically controlled (and also semi automatically controlled) flagger device, which can be easily use and much more cost effective.

Our demo project was on at 2018 New York MakerFaire.

It demo the very basic idea of how to control the flag, and direct the traffic.

The full line of "auto flagger" include three different level of flagger device.

1. remote controlled flagger

2. semi automatically controlled flagger (confirmed by worker, but trigger signal by highly sensitive camera)

3. fully automatically controlled flagger (no human involved, fully automatically controlled)

We will constantly improve our series of device, and hopefully, we can see it to be used in the real environment in near future.
